# Solenoid-Winding

This project is a home brewed encoder for measuring the number of windings 
added to a solenoid body.  


BOM:

Arduino Nano
16x2 LCD Display with Hitachi HD44780 controller
R1 - 220 ohm  IR LED power limit
R2 - 10k ohm  Phototransistor pullup
R3 - 1M ohm Pushbutton power limit 
C1 - 100 nf debounce
D1 - IR Led 940nm
Q1 - Phototransistor 

The external circuitry used +5V

The encoder housing is made of a sandwich of lasercut 1/4" plywood.
The endoder body is made of 1/8" plywood.

The drawings for the lasercutter were made in onshape
The drawing for the breadboard was made in tinkercad

The encoder is intended to be mounted on a piece of 2x8 stock with
a drill mounted to one side.  A 1/4" threaded rod is held in
the drill chuck.  The encoder wheel is mounted rigidly to the 
threaded rod.  Nuts and washers are used to hold the solenoid body
in place.
